hello sir,
ive been working on the bullets today and ive got some issues
im using the basic 1.code file in the referance file for simplicity and testing purposes.
for some reason the bullet only moves when the player moves and then continues to follow the player camera
i have not been able to figure these issues out , i was hoping you would have some ideas on this

trust,
sailu
